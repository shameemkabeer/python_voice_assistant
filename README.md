## What is a Voice Assistant?

A voice assistant or intelligent personal assistant is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on verbal commands i.e. by interpreting human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistantsâ€™ questions, control home automation devices, and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks.
